# Python Media Catalogue (OOP)

A Python application to manage a catalogue of movies and TV series using object-oriented programming principles.
Users can add movies or TV series, view all media items, and separate them by type in a clean catalogue display.

This project was built as part of the freeCodeCamp Python Certification labs.

# Features

- Create and validate movie and TV series objects

- Add media items to a central catalogue

- Automatically raise errors for invalid data

- Separate movies and TV series when displaying the catalogue

- Custom string representations for movies, TV series, and the catalogue

- Handles both parent (Movie) and child (TVSeries) class distinctions

# Concepts Used

- Classes & objects

- Inheritance and child-parent relationships

- Instance attributes & methods

- __str__ and __repr__ customization

- Exception handling (ValueError and custom MediaError)

- Encapsulation and responsibility separation

- Filtering items by type (Movie vs TVSeries)

# Technologies

- Python 3
